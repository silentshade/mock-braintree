# 0.4.0
* BREAKING CHANGES
* Modularized all classes in mock_braintree directory
* Support PaymentMethod, Customer, CreditCard (with BillingAddress) responses. CreditCard response is hardcoded for now.
* Added `gem 'braintree'` as a dependency. Gateways use Braintree validation of passed arguments.
 
# 0.3.0
* Add `created_at` attribute to transaction object
* Add `transaction.refund` call
* Add `transaction.void` call
* Have transaction response wait within 2 to 5 seconds to more closely mimic response time

# 0.2.1  
* Fix bug where transaction object would return new ID value each time called
* Removed `nonce` attribute from transaction object to match actual Braintree response

# 0.2.0  
* BREAKING CHANGE - separated transaction and result object. Depending on success, the result will now be either a `SuccessfulResult` or `UnsuccessfulResult` object that contains a transaction object. This was changed to better match an actual Braintree response

# 0.1.0  
* Add basic `transaction.sale` functionality with result object and `transaction` object
